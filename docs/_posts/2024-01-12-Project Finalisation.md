title: Project Finalisation
---

To finish our project, we prepared a presentation, recorded a video demo and wrote a report to summarize and reflect on our work. At the end of the project, we are proud to have achieved our goals and to have created a fully functional robotic bartender. We are also happy to have learned a lot about the different aspects of the project, from the conception of the idea to the implementation of the final product. We can conclude that we have successfully completed our project and are satisfied with the result. Botender - the robotic bartender - is ready to serve you a drink!
