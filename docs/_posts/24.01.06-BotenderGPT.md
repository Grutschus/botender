title: Botender - Advancing AI Personalization with OpenAI Integration
---

Our program is designed to identify and address people by their names, thereby raising the user experience to a new level of engagement.
This was achieved by enabling our AI system to offer personalized greetings. 

### Implementing a two-phase conversation structure
Our approach involved a two-phase conversation structure. Initially, the AI's focus is on gathering information from the user, with a particular emphasis on detecting the user's name. The subsequent phase involves the potential use of this name in the AI's response. A unique aspect of our system is the AI's autonomous role in determining whether it is confident enough to use the identified name.

### Crafting the right prompt for AI
The primary challenge for this task was to create a prompt that guides the AI effectively. The goal was for the AI to recognize when a user mentions their name in the beginning oft he conversation and then use this information in its response. The promt tells the system to search the text for the user's name, identify it, and then return "Error" or the identified name.To further increase the accuracy, a sample with the desired output and input is given.

### AI's autonomous confidence assessment

In contrast to conventional systems that require the setting of confidence criteria, our method makes use of the sophisticated features of the GPT-3.5-turbo to determine its own level of confidence. This implies that the AI decides for itself whether to use a user's name based on how well it understands the context of the interaction. By using this method, individualized interactions become more accurate and engaging while also feeling less artificial.

### Conclusion and future plans

We had no more problems after adjusting the prompt, indicating the strength and dependability of OpenAI's technology. The whole user experience has been much increased by this seamless integration, in addition to improving our system's name recognition efficiency.
In the future, even if our current solution makes use of OpenAI's robust features, investigating more affordable or free options could be a viable path for advancement. By doing this, we want to make our application fully functioning for a larger user base, guaranteeing that everyone can take use of our AI solution.
