## Scope

With Botender we want to create a social robot that can understand and adapt to the mood of the customer and recommend drinks accordingly.
This helps give customers the attention they deserve and personal recommendations for drinks, even if it's a busy night.

This blog will describe and follow the planning and development phases of our project.
